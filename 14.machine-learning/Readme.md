# Machine learning
- That is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome!
- To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with (numerical, categorical, ordianl)

# Standard deviation mean
- Standard deviation mean how much the values of data spread around the mean.
- **Low standard deviation** - data are near of the mean 
- **High standard deviation** - data are far from mean
- For example, if I have a monthly budget with a low deviation it means that my finance are stable. For other hand, if I have a high deviation may I have fencing finance problems or unexpected expenses.
