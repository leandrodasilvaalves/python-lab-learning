# Machine learning
- That is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome!
- To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with (numerical, categorical, ordianl)

# Standard deviation mean
- Standard deviation mean how much the values of data spread around the mean.
- **Low standard deviation** - data are near of the mean 
- **High standard deviation** - data are far from mean
- For example, if I have a monthly budget with a low deviation it means that my finance are stable. For other hand, if I have a high deviation may I have fencing finance problems or unexpected expenses.

# Percentiles
Are used in statistics to give you a number theat describes the value that a given percent of the values lower than.

```py
ages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]
```
What is the 75 percentile? 
The answer is 43, meaning that 75% of the people are 43 or younger.
