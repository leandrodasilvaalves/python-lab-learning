# print("Hello, world!")
print("Hello, world!")  #This is a comment

# Python does not really have syntax for multiline comments
# Since python will ignore string literals that are not assigned
# to a variable, you can add multiline
# Example:

"""
This is a comment
writhen in
more than just one line
"""

print("Hello, again!")
